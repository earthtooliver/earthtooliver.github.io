		"Yeah, and I always smoke pot with you, all of you, my pot, all the time, like hundreds and hundreds of dollars' worth. So why shouldn't I make some money offa you? You fuckin' guys like gripe at me all the time, and I'm providing you schmucks with such a crucial service. Plus I'm developing valuable entrepreneurial skills for my future. Plus I'm like providing you with precious memories of your youth, for when you're fuckin' old. I'm like the basis of half your personality. All you do is imitate me. I turned you onto The Honeymooners, Frank Zappa, Ernst Lubitch, boxer shorts, â€” Sushi. I'm like a one-man youth culture for you pathetic assholes. You're gonna remember your youth as like a gray stoned haze punctuated by a series of beatings from your Dad, and like, my jokes. God damn. You know how much pot I've thrown out the window for you guys in the middle of the night when you're wandering around the street like junkies looking for half a joint so you can go to sleep, because you scraped all the resin out of your pipes? And you bitch about the fact that along the way I turn a little profit? You should thank God you ever met me, you little fuckin' hero-worshipping little fag."
